    <h1>Films and Career</h1>
    <p>If you’re looking for drama, action, and science fiction, look no further than SYFY’s newest venture Blood Drive.
      The talented, handsome, and one of our favorite actors on the latest series
      Thomas Dominique gave CelebMix an exclusive interview about everything Blood Drive.
      We promise you’ll love him and be hooked on the show all at the same time.</p>

    <p>Tell us what drew you to Blood Drive.

      It was an absolutely insanely interesting script, with the intention of being on a regular cable channel…
      I thought; how are they going to get away with this? It was totally new ground for me, so it was a challenge that I wanted to take on.

      What can you tell us about your role?

      I play Christopher Carpenter, a cop in a privatised police force that gets in way over his head during an investigation. A lot of unpleasant things happen to him, and you find out a lot about the world these characters inhabit as we follow his
      part of the story.

      How does this show differ from what’ve seen on TV?

      People always say this is like nothing you’ve ever seen on TV… But you will see for yourself, this actually is like nothing you’ve ever seen on TV before lol. This show is absolutely crazy! It won’t be for everyone but if you’re even slightly
      entertained in the first episode it will hook you and drag you along for the ride. It’s a really fun show, you’ve seen some of this stuff in Movies but never on a cable TV show. It’s wild.

      What has been one of your favorite roles to date?

      I would have to say my role as Christopher Carpenter has been one of my favorite roles to date. As I said it’s like nothing I’ve ever done before, so it pushed me into new territory and helped me grow as an actor.

      What made you want to become an actor?

      I grew up watching Movies and TV, I loved the stories people were telling. I really wanted to tell stories too, and hoped to have an effect on people the way Movies had an effect on me.

      If you could choose any role in the world to play, what would it be?

      That’s a tough one, there’s so many I would like have a go at. At this moment in time, maybe playing a character like John Wick. I love deep dramatic roles, but I want to try an all out action role and get to challenge myself physically as well
      as mentally. At least while I physically can, I don’t know if I’ll be as spryly as Keanu is at his age lol I’m a bit taller.

      Any future projects in the works?

      I’ve had a few meetings with some amazing Directors, but nothing I can really talk about. So we’ll have to wait and see.

      What would you love to tell your fans that they don’t already know?

      Fans? Hmmm… If they want to know anything I’m sure they’ll find me and ask me.
      But I will say; if you have a dream chase it, and don’t let anyone tell you that it’s not going to happen. Everyone’s path is different – it might take you longer, but be persistent and consistent and if it’s for you, it won’t miss you.</p>
